__Assignment:__
Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008) perform their Monte Carlo study with a symmetric set-up. In the follow-up literature it has been highlighted that skewness of regressors make the problem worse. 
Reproduce (part of) their analysis using a skewed “treatment” variable.


To reproduce our results, simply open and run the _to_run.R_ file. Additionnaly, you can export results in table format using the _results.R_ file.
